I don't wanna die alone
I don't wanna live forsaken
I refuse to let this go
Because my soul is breaking

I don't wanna let you know
That my heart is just so jaded
I reeeeefusee to let it show
I reefuse to let it go

Wake me up when this is over hello
I'm tired of living life like its a dream
Please wake me up when its all over
I'm tired of living right here in between
I refuse

I've always walked alone
I chose the path less taken
I refuse to let you win
Life's a bitch and I've been shaken
